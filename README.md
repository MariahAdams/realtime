# Realtime Redux Lab

## Project Description
For this project, we were asked to build a simple game with React that integrates data from Firebase's realtime database with Redux. 

This app is a variation on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors based on the TV Show Big Bang Theory. The rules are much the same, but with a few twists. Here are the rules for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock:

"As Sheldon explains in an episode of Big Bang Theory, 'Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.'"
